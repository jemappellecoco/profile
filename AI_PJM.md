<h2 id="📝-about-me">📝 About Me</h2>
<p>With hands-on experience in NLP and generative AI, I enjoy turning “what if” ideas into real products that people actually find useful and fun.<br>
Working in a bilingual environment every day, I’m comfortable switching between Mandarin and English to collaborate across teams and cultures.</p>
<p>I have a genuine interest in AI and product design, and I like keeping up with new trends—not just for work, but because learning new things is something I truly enjoy.<br>
I’m naturally curious, love chatting with teammates to exchange ideas, and often gather different perspectives to help shape better and more thoughtful products.</p>
